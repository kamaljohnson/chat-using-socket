# chat-using-socket
a simple program for chatting between two computers connected over a LAN

I had made use of the socket module in python for connecting (passing data from one computer to the other) two computers in my program
what this program basically does is that 
when one of the user is sending a message then the sending person acts as a client and the receiving person acts as the server and vis versa
